### sign-gradient-move
A fresh new look. This colour gradient is somewhat similar to the one found on the main [LinuxMint](https://linuxmint.com/) website. And the strong difference in hues makes the logo standout from the background bar. (Enlarged view)

![](sign-flat-2X.png)
### sign-flat
This is the standard logo colour, on the logo. And the background bar gets its colour value from the top-left edge of the gradient colour on the main website. (Enlarged view)

------

![](sign-gray-2X.png)
### sign-gray
This is the standard logo colour, on the logo. And the background bar gets a pure neutral grey. The contrast is very good for the text. And here again the logo stands out against the background bar. (Enlarged view)

### sign-flat-move
This is the standard logo colour, on the logo. And the background bar gets its colour value from the top-left edge of the gradient colour on the main website. (Enlarged view)

### sign-flat-move-sharp
This is the standard logo colour, on the logo. And the background bar gets this same logo colour. On previous versions those two colours were very similar, and thus it felt like some error. Here they are just both exactly the same `#86BE43`.

Here there is no shadow on the background bar, giving it a sharper look. And there are no left and right margins, allowing a perfect left or right alignment. (Enlarged view)

### sign-twotones-move-sharp
A fresh new look. The two colour tones used here makes a good contrast between the logo and the background bar. The logo stands out. And the background hue sits within the colour gradient as found on the main website, somewhere near the bottom-right edge.

Here there is no shadow on the background bar, giving it a sharper look. And there are no left and right margins, allowing a perfect left or right alignment. (Enlarged view)

### sign-twotones2-move-sharp
A fresh new look. The logo stands out. The background colour is the same as this "navbar" on LinuxMint's main website. I mean this fixed "navbar" that you get as you scroll down the page, with this `#68C174` colour.

Here there is no shadow on the background bar, giving it a sharper look. And there are no left and right margins, allowing a perfect left or right alignment. (Enlarged view)
